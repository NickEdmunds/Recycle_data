Data for chapters 2 and 5 of PhD thesis: Improvements to methods for the quality estimation and refinement of protein quaternary structure models.
Published July 2024 (University of Reading)
Chapter 2 data is a set of datasets containing recycled AF2 (AF2_Scores_AF2_19_10_22.csv) and non-AF2 models (AF2_Scores_next5_19_10_22.csv).
Chapter 5 data uses the same data as chapter 2 but additionally uses a set of models created by MultiFOLD for monomeric and multimeric CASP15 targets as well as a similar 
dataset for ColabFold models - the colabFold models are publically available from https://casp15.colabfol.com/.
